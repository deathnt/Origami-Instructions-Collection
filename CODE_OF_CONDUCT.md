* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki)
* Project communications (comments, commit messages)
* Social media accounts associated with the project
* Events or gatherings representing the project
* Online or offline spaces where an individual is representing the project or community

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing the project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team through:

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

## Special Guidelines for Origami Content

Given the nature of this project, additional guidelines apply:

* **Quality**: Ensure instructions are clear, accurate, and helpful. Low-quality or intentionally confusing instructions harm the community.
* **Accessibility**: Strive to make instructions accessible to folders of all skill levels.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from:
* [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0
* Community best practices for open-source projects

## Questions or Concerns

If you have questions about this Code of Conduct or its enforcement, please open an issue or contact the project maintainers.
