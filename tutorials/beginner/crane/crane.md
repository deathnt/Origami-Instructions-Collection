## Description

The paper crane (折り鶴, orizuru) is one of the most iconic and recognizable origami designs. This traditional Japanese model has been folded for centuries and symbolizes peace, hope, and healing. The crane is considered a sacred bird in Japanese culture and is said to live for a thousand years. According to legend, folding 1,000 paper cranes grants the folder a wish.

This tutorial will guide you through creating a classic paper crane with flapping wings, perfect for beginners learning fundamental origami techniques.

## Materials Needed

- 1 square sheet of origami paper (15cm x 15cm recommended for beginners)
- Flat folding surface
- Optional: Bone folder or ruler for crisp creases

**Paper Recommendations:**
- Traditional kami (standard origami paper) works best
- Use colored paper with one white side to better visualize folds
- Avoid thick cardstock for your first attempts
- Thinner paper (60-70 gsm) makes the final steps easier

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, you should be familiar with:
- Basic valley and mountain folds
- Inside reverse fold
- Outside reverse fold (optional, for advanced finish)
- Squash fold

If you're new to origami, practice these basic folds first or follow along carefully with each step.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Part 1: Creating the Square Base

**Step 1: Initial Valley Folds**
- Start with your paper colored side down (white side up)
- Fold the paper in half diagonally, bringing the top corner to the bottom corner
- Crease well and unfold
- Rotate the paper 90 degrees
- Fold in half diagonally again, the other way
- Crease well and unfold
- You should now have an X-shaped crease pattern

**Step 2: Horizontal Folds**
- Turn the paper over so the colored side is facing up
- Fold the paper in half horizontally, bringing the top edge to the bottom edge
- Crease well and unfold
- Fold in half vertically, bringing the left edge to the right edge
- Crease well and unfold
- Turn the paper back over (white side up)

**Step 3: Collapse into Square Base**
- Hold the paper with the white side facing up
- Bring all four corners together at the bottom, allowing the horizontal creases to collapse inward
- This creates a square base with four flaps (two on each side)
- Flatten the model carefully, ensuring all creases are sharp
- Your square base should look like a small diamond with a center point at the top

### Part 2: Creating the Bird Base

**Step 4: Preliminary Folds on Square Base**
- Orient the square base so the open end (loose flaps) points toward you
- Take the right edge of the top layer and fold it to the center vertical line
- Crease well
- Repeat with the left edge of the top layer, folding it to the center
- The model should now look like a kite shape

**Step 5: Fold Down the Top Triangle**
- Take the top triangle and fold it down over the folds you just made
- Crease well
- Unfold all three folds you just made (the two sides and the top triangle)
- These creases will guide the next step

**Step 6: Petal Fold**
- Lift the top layer of the bottom point upward
- As you lift, allow the sides to fold inward along the creases you just made
- Bring the bottom point all the way up to the top point
- Flatten carefully, forming a long diamond shape
- This is called a petal fold

**Step 7: Repeat on the Back**
- Turn the model over
- Repeat steps 4-6 on this side
- You now have a bird base, which is the foundation for the crane

### Part 3: Forming the Crane

**Step 8: Fold the Sides to the Center**
- Orient the bird base so the split legs point downward
- Take the right edge of the top layer and fold it to the center line
- Crease well
- Repeat with the left edge of the top layer
- Turn the model over and repeat on the back
- The model should be narrow and look like a tall, thin kite

**Step 9: Create the Neck and Tail**
- Orient the model so the two narrow points face down (these will become legs)
- Take the right lower flap and fold it upward along the diagonal edge
- Crease well, then unfold
- Open the model slightly and reverse fold this flap inside and upward
- The flap should now point diagonally upward (this will be the tail)
- Repeat on the left side (this will be the neck)

**Step 10: Form the Head**
- Take the tip of one of the narrow points (the neck)
- Fold it down slightly to create a small bend
- Unfold, then reverse fold to form the head
- The head should be at about a 45-degree angle to the neck

**Step 11: Create the Wings**
- Hold the model by the neck and tail
- Gently pull the wings apart horizontally
- The body will flatten slightly between them
- Adjust the wing angles so they are symmetrical

**Step 12: Final Adjustments**
- Adjust the head, neck, and tail positions as desired
- Ensure the wings are even and properly shaped
- Optional: Gently pull the tail backward while holding the neck to make the wings flap

## Tips and Tricks

- **Precision is key:** Sharp, accurate creases make all the difference. Take your time with each fold.
- **Paper size matters:** If you're struggling, try using larger paper (20cm x 20cm or even 25cm x 25cm).
- **Practice the reverse fold:** The neck and tail use inside reverse folds. If this is challenging, practice this technique separately.
- **Symmetry:** Always ensure your folds are symmetrical. Line up edges and corners precisely.
- **The petal fold:** This is often the trickiest step for beginners. Watch the creases carefully and let them guide the paper naturally.
- **Wing adjustment:** Don't over-flatten the wings. Leave some dimension for a more realistic bird.
- **Paper choice:** Use standard origami paper for your first attempts. Washi or chiyogami papers work beautifully for display cranes.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Imprecise base folds:** If your initial diagonal and horizontal folds aren't exact, the entire model will be off-center.
   - *Solution:* Take extra time with the first few folds. Use a ruler or bone folder for perfectly straight creases.

2. **Forcing the petal fold:** Trying to force the petal fold without following the crease pattern.
   - *Solution:* Make sure your preliminary creases are well-defined before attempting the petal fold.

3. **Asymmetrical bird base:** One side larger or positioned differently than the other.
   - *Solution:* Ensure you're repeating folds identically on both sides. Check alignment frequently.

4. **Difficulty with reverse folds:** The inside reverse fold for the neck and tail can be confusing.
   - *Solution:* First make a clear crease, then open the model slightly to push the fold inside.

5. **Wings won't stay in place:** Wings keep collapsing or won't spread properly.
   - *Solution:* Make sure you've pulled the wings apart gently but firmly, allowing the body to flatten between them.

## Variations

- **Tiny cranes:** Try folding with 3cm x 3cm paper for miniature cranes (requires experience)
- **Metallic cranes:** Use foil or metallic origami paper for elegant decorative cranes
- **Patterned cranes:** Use chiyogami or yuzen paper for beautiful traditional patterns
- **Modular cranes:** Connect multiple cranes to create garlands or mobiles
- **Peace crane:** The traditional version, often made in groups of 1,000 (senbazuru)

## Cultural Significance

The origami crane holds special significance in Japanese culture:
- **Symbol of peace:** Made famous by Sadako Sasaki, a victim of the Hiroshima atomic bombing, who folded cranes while battling leukemia
- **Senbazuru:** The tradition of folding 1,000 cranes to make a wish, often given to wish someone recovery from illness
- **Wedding symbol:** Cranes mate for life and symbolize longevity and good fortune in marriage
- **Good luck:** Often given as gifts to wish good health, happiness, and prosperity

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** My paper keeps tearing during the petal fold.  
**Solution:** Use thinner, more flexible paper. Make sure all preliminary creases are well-defined before attempting the petal fold.

**Problem:** The neck and tail won't stay in position.  
**Solution:** Make sure you're making inside reverse folds, not just folding them up. The fold should tuck inside the body layers.

**Problem:** The finished crane looks lopsided.  
**Solution:** Go back and check that all your folds are symmetrical. Pay special attention to the bird base stage.

**Problem:** The wings won't spread apart.  
**Solution:** You may have over-creased the wing area. Gently unfold and refold, leaving the wings slightly rounded rather than flat.

## Credits and History

The paper crane is a traditional origami design with origins dating back hundreds of years in Japanese culture. The exact creator is unknown, as it has been passed down through generations. The model gained worldwide recognition in the 1950s through the story of Sadako Sasaki and has since become an international symbol of peace and hope.
